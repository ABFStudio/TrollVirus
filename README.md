# A troll virus

This is a very simple Python virus, which doesn't do illegal actions. It just spawns tons of troll images and it blocks the keyboard ans mouse in Windows.

## Run
```
pip3 (or pip) install -r requirements.txt
python3 (or python) decode.py
```
And it will run the program on your system. There is an executable file in the `bin` fodler for Windows only.
